    interestingFact: 'Lemurs possess an odd, compressed fingernail called a “toilet-claw.” Yes, we said toilet-claw! This claw can be found on a number of different primate species, and is used for grooming and parasite removal.',

    interestingFact: 'Sea otters have the densest fur of any animal. They can have over 1,000,000 hairs per square inch on their bodies! For comparison, humans have just 100,000 hairs on their entire head! That dense coat allows sea otters to dive beneath the waves without the water ever touching their skin. Because they are so well insulated, sea otters do not require a layer of blubber for survival like other marine mammals do.',

    interestingFact: 'Like all rodents, capybaras’ teeth grow indefinitely. Their long incisors, used to gnaw on plant matter, grow continuously their entire lives. This trait is very useful to them because chewing on plant matter can grind down teeth very quickly. Unfortunately, if these creatures don’t get enough opportunities to chew, their teeth can grow too long for their mouths. Overgrown teeth can keep them from being able to eat food, and they can starve.',

    interestingFact: 'Instead of bathing in water, Chukars use loose dust and sand to clean their feathers. They dig a small dip in the ground, lie in it, and use their wings to throw sand up over their backs. From there, they shuffle comically around to distribute the dust throughout their feathers.

    interestingFact: 'When living in the trees, animals must have good balance or risk a potentially fatal fall. One common adaptation to aid in this danger is the use of a tail for balance. Fossae have tails that are nearly as long as their body. This provides great counterbalance when walking along branches.',

They are notoriously feisty, and will bare their teeth, growl, and lunge at any potential threat. They fight with potential predators, protect their food, and compete for mates.
